    <h1>Q&A<h1>
      <h2>What is the role of the index.html file?</h2>
        <p>ðŸ“ŒThe index.html file in the provided starting code serves as the main entry point for a web application or website.</p>
      <h2>What is the URL you used to view the page? Is it HTTP or HTTPS?</h2>
        <p>ðŸ“Œhttp://localhost:5173/ uses HTTP</p>
      <h2>What HTTP status code do you see for index.html? What does it mean?</h2>
        <p>ðŸ“ŒThe HTTP status is 200 OK, meaning the request was successful and the file was served properly.</p>
      <h2>How can you tell the page is being served locally vs from a real domain?</h2>
        <p>ðŸ“ŒIf it is being served locally, the URL starts with localhost, 127.0.0.1, or file:/// instead of a domain like example.com.</p>
      <h2>What tools did you use to inspect the response?</h2>
        <p>ðŸ“ŒI use Browser Developer Tools (F12) to inspect the response and check the HTTP status code and details in the Network tab.</p>
